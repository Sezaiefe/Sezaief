Please do not harass the first two authors who want to play games or report bugs or submit suggestions, because they are no longer making this game
You can press "Tab" to change the bgm and the old words in phase 1 before the first round.
HELL MODE only updated the first and third phases, and new content may be added in the future.
All the battles "in the bottles" are belong to the "Phase 3 - Ex" which does not belong to the "Phase 4".
Press "G" in the game to get some food. If you press G before entering the Phase3-Ex (not including quitting the game), then your HP will become 333 instead of 198.(P.s. Now eating the first pie will not make the hp bar exceed the hp limit.)
This version does not include the "Phase 4", so the version number is 0.3x.
The next version number will be 0.41. The confirmed content includes the update of the Phase3 attack type pool and the addition of the Phase 4.
If you find a strange place after opening the game, or if you want to remove the save files, please use the "Reset" in "MERCY".
If you hacked this game, please do not spread the content that does not officially appear in this version. Thank you.
Please indicate the author when publishing the video of this game (written in the first line).
